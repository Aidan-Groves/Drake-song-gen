Hello, this is my first coding project, I used a RNN based on a dataset of Drake lyrics to create new song lyrics
They are not fantastic but it does work. The dataset is not as large as possible but I did this for extra credit for my Neural Networks and AI class so I did not have the time to create the most robust dataset.
I attempted some basic song generation with music but that was much much harder to gather a dataset for and I had to make that all my own which was very limited.
